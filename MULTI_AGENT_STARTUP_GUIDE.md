# 🚀 Multi-Agent Claude Code Startup Guide

## ✅ System Ready!
- **Worktrees**: 2 isolated instances created
- **Auto-approval**: Configured for safe development operations
- **TaskMaster**: Integrated and ready
- **Coordination**: Shared memory bank linked

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

### Terminal Tab 1 (Instance 1 - Project Setup):
```bash
cd ~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp-instance-1
claude
```
**First message**: "Read INSTANCE_1_INSTRUCTIONS.md and start Task #1 - Project Setup"

### Terminal Tab 2 (Instance 2 - Research):
```bash
cd ~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp-instance-2  
claude
```
**First message**: "Read INSTANCE_2_INSTRUCTIONS.md and start Task #2 - iTerm MCP Analysis"

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Auto-Approved Operations:
- ✅ File read/write/create/move operations
- ✅ npm install, build, test, run commands
- ✅ git add, commit, status, diff, push
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and linting
- ✅ Directory creation and navigation

### Still Require Approval:
- ❌ Destructive operations (rm -rf, sudo)
- ❌ Global installs/uninstalls
- ❌ System-level changes
- ❌ Protected file modifications

## 📊 Monitoring Progress

Check coordination status anytime:
```bash
claude-coordination-status ~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp
task-master dashboard
git worktree list
```

## 🧹 Cleanup When Done:
```bash
claude-cleanup-worktrees '/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp'
```

## 🎪 Expected Timeline:
- **30 minutes**: Initial setup and analysis progress
- **1-2 hours**: Major deliverables from both instances
- **2-3 hours**: Coordinated enhanced iTerm MCP foundation complete

**Ready for autonomous multi-agent development!** 🎉

Both instances can work independently while sharing discoveries through the memory bank and TaskMaster coordination system.
