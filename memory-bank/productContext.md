# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Claude Desktop Tool (CDT) operates as a single-threaded application, which creates significant limitations for complex, multi-faceted projects. When working on comprehensive tasks that could benefit from parallel processing or multiple perspectives, users must manually manage multiple Claude Code (CC) instances, leading to:

- **Context Loss**: Switching between tasks in CDT loses conversation context
- **Coordination Overhead**: Manual management of multiple CC instances is time-consuming
- **Error Prone**: Human coordination between AI instances leads to inconsistencies
- **Scalability Limits**: Cannot efficiently handle complex projects requiring parallel work

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **AI-Assisted Developers**: Using Claude Desktop Tool for complex development projects
- **Services Business Owners**: Managing multiple client projects requiring AI coordination
- **Technical Consultants**: Delivering comprehensive analysis and recommendations

### Specific User: Dean's Services Business
- **Current Pain**: Proposal anxiety due to manual coordination complexity
- **Need**: Systematic automation for multi-faceted client projects
- **Goal**: Demonstrate advanced AI orchestration capabilities to clients

## Market Context
The AI tooling ecosystem is rapidly evolving toward more sophisticated automation and orchestration. Current tools like Claude Desktop Tool, while powerful, are designed for single-threaded interaction. There's a growing need for:

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Tools that can manage multiple AI instances
- **Systematic automation**: Reducing human intervention in routine AI workflows
- **Professional services enhancement**: AI tools that scale professional service delivery

## Assumptions and Risks

### Key Assumptions
- iTerm2 AppleScript APIs provide sufficient access for session management
- Claude Code instances can be reliably automated through programmatic prompting
- Users will benefit from increased automation despite reduced direct control
- The services business model benefits from demonstrating advanced AI capabilities

### Primary Risks
- **Technical Risk**: AppleScript limitations may prevent full session control
- **User Adoption Risk**: Users may resist increased automation
- **Integration Risk**: Complex interactions with existing MCP ecosystem
- **Business Risk**: Over-automation may reduce perceived human value in services

### Risk Mitigation
- Develop incrementally with fallback to manual processes
- Implement safety tiers for gradual automation adoption
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- Use real-world validation (Walt Opie project) before full deployment

## Integration Points

### Technical Integration
- **Existing iTerm MCP**: Extend rather than replace current functionality
- **Claude Desktop Tool**: Seamless integration with CDT workflows
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Full compliance with Model Context Protocol standards
- **Development Tools**: Integration with existing development and deployment workflows

### Business Integration
- **Walt Opie Project**: Real-world validation and testing
- **Services Business Workflow**: Integration with client project delivery
- **Proposal Process**: Demonstration capabilities for client acquisition
- **Quality Standards**: Systematic application of consistent processes across projects

This enhanced iTerm MCP addresses a clear gap in the current AI tooling ecosystem while providing specific business value for scaling professional services through systematic AI orchestration.
