# Instance 2 Progress Report

## Status: Research and Analysis Complete ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Analyzed existing iTerm MCP implementation**
   - Studied ferrislucas/iterm-mcp architecture
   - Identified three core tools: write_to_terminal, read_terminal_output, send_control_character
   - Documented implementation patterns and extension points

2. ✅ **Researched iTerm2 automation capabilities**
   - Comprehensive AppleScript API documentation reviewed
   - Identified session management capabilities
   - Documented object hierarchy: Application > Windows > Tabs > Sessions

3. ✅ **Designed multi-session architecture**
   - Created detailed session model and lifecycle management
   - Designed new MCP tools for session operations
   - Planned backward compatibility approach

4. ✅ **Planned Claude Code orchestration**
   - Designed agent coordination model
   - Created communication mechanisms (shared memory, event bus, messaging)
   - Defined orchestration patterns (parallel, pipeline, specialist)

### Key Deliverables Created

1. **`iterm-mcp-analysis.md`** - Comprehensive analysis of current implementation
2. **`multi-session-architecture.md`** - Detailed multi-session management design
3. **`claude-orchestration-plan.md`** - Complete orchestration feature specification
4. **`implementation-guide.md`** - Step-by-step guide for Instance 1 to begin Task #1

### Critical Findings

1. **Extension Strategy**: Add new tools with `session_` prefix while keeping original tools unchanged
2. **AppleScript Integration**: Use iTerm's scripting variables for session tracking
3. **Architecture Pattern**: Modular design with SessionManager as core component
4. **Safety Approach**: Implement tiered permissions (Tier 1: read-only, Tier 2: supervised, Tier 3: manual)

### Recommendations for Instance 1

1. **Start with Task #1**: Use the implementation guide to set up the TypeScript project
2. **Focus on Core**: Build SessionManager and AppleScriptBridge first
3. **Test Early**: Verify AppleScript commands work before building abstractions
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure existing three tools continue working unchanged

### Technical Insights

- **Performance**: AppleScript commands should be cached and batched when possible
- **State Management**: Use iTerm's user-defined variables for session metadata
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for AppleScript timeouts
- **Testing**: Both unit tests (logic) and integration tests (iTerm interaction) are critical

### Next Steps

Instance 1 can now proceed with Task #1 implementation using the provided guides. All research materials are available in `/memory-bank-shared/` for reference.

## Questions for Coordination

1. Should we prioritize TypeScript or JavaScript for initial implementation?
2. What testing framework preference: Jest, Vitest, or other?
3. Any specific iTerm2 version requirements to consider?
