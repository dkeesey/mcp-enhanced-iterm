# Enhanced iTerm MCP Project Brief

## Project Name
Enhanced iTerm MCP for Parallel Claude Code Orchestration

## Core Purpose
Develop an advanced iTerm MCP server that enables multi-session management and autonomous Claude Code orchestration, solving CDT's single-threaded limitations by delegating parallel work to multiple CC instances.

## Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: 3-5x faster completion of multi-faceted projects
- **Reliability**: 90% fewer coordination errors between processes  
- **Autonomy**: 80% of routine tasks execute without intervention
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing iTerm MCP

## Key Stakeholders
- **Primary User**: Dean (for services business automation)
- **Clients**: Walt Opie (validation project), future business clients
- **Technical Users**: Claude Desktop Tool users, Claude Code users
- **Business Impact**: Systematic automation for services business scalability

## TaskMaster Integration
This project uses TaskMaster for:
- Structured task management with dependency tracking
- Git workflow integration with automatic task completion
- Cursor AI context for development assistance
- Progress tracking and complexity analysis
- Memory-driven development with persistent context

## Project Scope
**Included:**
- Multi-session iTerm management via AppleScript
- Claude Code orchestration and direct prompting
- Task distribution and parallel execution
- Safety tier implementation for autonomous operation
- Performance monitoring and error recovery
- Integration with existing MCP ecosystem

**Excluded:**
- Support for terminal applications other than iTerm2
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS only initially)
- Integration with non-Claude AI models
- GUI interface (CLI/API only)

## Technical Approach
- **Foundation**: Extend existing iTerm MCP rather than building from scratch
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript for MCP compatibility
- **Integration**: AppleScript APIs for iTerm session management
- **Architecture**: Modular design with backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Real-world validation with Walt Opie project

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Enhanced session management
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Claude Code orchestration
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Enterprise features and safety tiers
- **Validation**: Walt Opie project as real-world test case
- **Demo Preparation**: Client demonstration for services business
