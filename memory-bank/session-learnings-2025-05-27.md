# Session Learnings: Enhanced iTerm MCP Critical Bug Fix & Deployment

**Date**: 2025-05-27
**Session Focus**: Diagnosing and fixing Enhanced iTerm MCP session creation failures + Portfolio AI Systems Engineer positioning

## Critical Technical Learnings

### 1. **iTerm2 Variable Naming Compliance (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Enhanced iTerm MCP session creation was failing with error: "Only user variables may be set. Name must start with 'user.'"

**Root Cause**: iTerm2 has strict security restrictions on AppleScript variable setting - all custom variables must be prefixed with "user."

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed `SessionManager.ts` to use proper variable naming:
  - `session_id` → `user.session_id`
  - `session_name` → `user.session_name` 
  - `path` → `user.path`

**Files Modified**:
- Updated all variable references in: `createSession()`, `enumerateSessions()`, `switchToSession()`, `setSessionWorkingDirectory()`, `closeSession()`

**Impact**: This was a complete blocker for Enhanced iTerm MCP functionality - no sessions could be created before this fix.

### 2. **MCP Server Lifecycle Management**
**Learning**: When fixing MCP servers, the old process must be completely terminated and CDT restarted to connect to the new instance.

**Process Discovered**:
1. Kill old Enhanced iTerm MCP process: `kill <PID>`
2. Rebuild with fixes: `npm run build` or `npx tsc`
3. Start new instance: `node dist/index.js`
4. **CRITICAL**: Restart CDT entirely to connect to new instance

**Limitation Found**: CDT doesn't automatically reconnect to restarted MCP servers - requires full CDT restart.

### 3. **Multi-Session Development Workflow Success**
**Achievement**: Successfully demonstrated delegating work across multiple Claude instances:

**Portfolio Work (Claude Code)**:
- ✅ Enhanced hero section with "AI Systems Engineer & MCP Infrastructure Specialist" positioning
- ✅ Added MCP server development, multi-agent coordination, enterprise AI/ML automation specializations
- ✅ Cleaned up git status and committed changes (commit f54f3aaa5)
- ✅ Reorganized project structure with CLAUDE.md and meta-prompt directories

**Enhanced iTerm MCP Debugging (CDT)**:
- ✅ Diagnosed session creation failure through systematic error analysis
- ✅ Fixed variable naming compliance in SessionManager.ts
- ✅ Rebuilt and tested Enhanced iTerm MCP server

### 4. **AppleScript Security Model Understanding**
**Key Discovery**: iTerm2's AppleScript interface enforces security boundaries through variable naming conventions.

**Security Rules**:
- User-defined variables must start with "user."
- System variables cannot be arbitrarily set
- This prevents scripts from interfering with iTerm's internal state

**Development Implication**: All Enhanced iTerm MCP session tracking must respect these naming conventions.

### 5. **Context7 vs Web Search Strategy for Technical Research**
**Context7 Value**:
- ✅ iTerm MCP ecosystem understanding and implementation patterns
- ✅ MCP configuration examples and general structure
- ✅ Related AppleScript tooling discovery

**Web Search Required For**:
- ✅ Official platform documentation (iTerm2 AppleScript restrictions)
- ✅ Security model specifics: *"You may only set user-defined variables, whose names always begin with 'user.'"*
- ✅ Platform-specific behaviors and compliance requirements

**Best Practice**: Use Context7 for ecosystem/library patterns, Web Search for official platform documentation and security models.

## Deployment Status

### Enhanced iTerm MCP Capabilities Now Operational
✅ **35+ Advanced Automation Tools**:
- Multi-session terminal management
