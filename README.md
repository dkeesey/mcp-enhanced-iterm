# Enhanced iTerm MCP ðŸš€

**Multi-session iTerm2 orchestration for Claude Desktop - Coordinate multiple Claude Code instances like a conductor!**

## What is this?

Enhanced iTerm MCP extends the original iTerm MCP with powerful multi-session capabilities, allowing Claude Desktop to:
- ðŸŽ¯ Manage multiple iTerm2 sessions simultaneously  
- ðŸ¤– Coordinate multiple Claude Code instances
- ðŸ“Š Distribute complex tasks across AI agents
- ðŸ”’ Enforce three-tier safety controls
- ðŸ“ˆ Monitor performance in real-time
- ðŸ”„ Recover from errors automatically

## Quick Start

### 1. Install
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project
cd /Users/deankeesey/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop
Quit and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

### 3. Test It
Ask Claude: "List all available iTerm sessions"

## Key Features

### 32 MCP Tools Available
- **Session Management** (8 tools) - Create, switch, manage multiple sessions
- **Task Distribution** (4 tools) - Split work across Claude instances  
- **Progress Tracking** (4 tools) - Monitor and aggregate results
- **Safety Controls** (6 tools) - Three-tier safety system
- **Performance Monitoring** (4 tools) - Real-time metrics
- **Error Recovery** (5 tools) - Automatic retry and health checks
- **Validation** (1 tool) - Test the system

### Safety Tiers
- **Tier 1**: Full autonomy (safe operations only)
- **Tier 2**: Supervised execution (requires approval)
- **Tier 3**: Manual control only (strict limits)

## Example Usage

### Create Multiple Sessions
```
Claude: "Create 3 iTerm sessions for parallel analysis"
```

### Distribute Complex Task
```
Claude: "Distribute these tasks across Claude Code instances:
1. Analyze the codebase structure
2. Find security vulnerabilities  
3. Suggest performance improvements
4. Generate documentation"
```

### Monitor Performance
```
Claude: "Show me performance metrics for all active sessions"
```

## Manual Installation

If the installer doesn't work, see [INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for manual steps.

## Configuration

Edit Claude Desktop config at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/enhanced-iterm-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
