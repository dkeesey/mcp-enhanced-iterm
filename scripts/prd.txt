# Enhanced iTerm MCP - Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Develop an advanced iTerm MCP server that enables multi-session management and autonomous Claude Code orchestration, solving CDT's single-threaded limitations by delegating parallel work to multiple CC instances.

## Business Context
**Problem**: Claude Desktop Tool (CDT) is single-threaded and loses context when switching between tasks. Manual management of multiple Claude Code (CC) instances is inefficient and error-prone.

**Solution**: Enhanced iTerm MCP that provides systematic AI orchestration capabilities, enabling parallel work distribution across multiple CC instances with automatic coordination.

**Value**: 3-5x faster completion of complex projects, 90% reduction in coordination errors, 80% autonomous operation for routine tasks.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Multi-session Management**: Control multiple iTerm sessions programmatically
2. **Claude Code Orchestration**: Direct prompting and coordination of CC instances
3. **Parallel Task Execution**: Distribute work across multiple AI instances
4. **Autonomous Operation**: Minimize manual intervention in routine workflows

### Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: 3-5x faster completion of multi-faceted projects
- **Reliability**: 90% fewer coordination errors between processes
- **Autonomy**: 80% of routine tasks execute without intervention
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing iTerm MCP

## Feature Requirements

### Core Features (Phase 1 - Weeks 1-2)
1. **Enhanced Session Management**
   - Enumerate all active iTerm tabs/windows with unique IDs
   - Send commands to specific sessions by ID/name/tag
   - Read output from multiple sessions simultaneously
   - Monitor session states and running processes

2. **Advanced API Extensions**
   ```javascript
   // New API methods beyond current iTerm MCP
   list_terminal_sessions()                    // Discover all sessions
   read_session_output(session_id, lines)     // Target specific session
   write_to_session(session_id, command)      // Send to specific session
   create_session(name, working_directory)    // Create new session
   monitor_all_sessions()                     // Parallel monitoring
   get_session_state(session_id)              // Session status
   ```

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain all existing iTerm MCP functionality
   - Ensure seamless upgrade path
   - No breaking changes for current implementations

### Advanced Features (Phase 2 - Weeks 3-4)
1. **Claude Code Orchestration**
   - Direct prompting to specific CC instances
   - Task distribution algorithms
   - Progress aggregation and reporting
   - Error detection and recovery

2. **Coordination System**
   - Enable indirect communication between CC instances
   - Dependency management for sequential/parallel tasks
   - Resource allocation and load balancing

### Enterprise Features (Phase 3 - Weeks 5-6)
1. **Safety Tiers Implementation**
   - **Tier 1**: Full autonomy for safe operations (file analysis, reports)
   - **Tier 2**: Supervised execution (propose → approve → execute)
   - **Tier 3**: Manual control for strategic decisions

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Resource usage tracking (CPU/memory per CC instance)
   - Real-time output streaming and aggregation
   - Notification system for task completion/errors
   - Session persistence across system restarts

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript (consistent with existing MCP ecosystem)
- **Framework**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard
- **Platform**: macOS (iTerm2 integration via AppleScript)
- **Dependencies**: Existing iTerm MCP as foundation
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Integration Requirements
- **MCP Compatibility**: Full compliance with MCP standards
- **iTerm Integration**: AppleScript APIs for session management
- **Claude Desktop**: Seamless integration with CDT workflow
- **Claude Code**: Direct prompting and coordination capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for session enumeration
- **Throughput**: Handle 10+ concurrent CC instances
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB additional overhead
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for session coordination

### Security Requirements
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments
- **Permission Management**: Granular control over session access
- **Audit Logging**: Track all session commands and outputs
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one session don't affect others
