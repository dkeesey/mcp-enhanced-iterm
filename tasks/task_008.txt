# Title: Task Distribution Algorithm
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design system for distributing work across multiple CC instances
# Details:
Create intelligent task distribution logic that can split complex work across multiple Claude Code instances based on task type, complexity, and instance availability.

# Test Strategy:
Test with a complex task that gets distributed across 3+ CC instances with successful coordination.
