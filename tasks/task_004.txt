# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Session-Targeted Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable reading and writing to specific iTerm sessions
# Details:
Implement read_session_output() and write_to_session() functions that can target specific sessions by ID, with proper error handling for non-existent sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify commands are sent to correct sessions, output is read from intended sessions, and error handling works for invalid session IDs.
