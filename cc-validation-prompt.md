# Claude Code: Enhanced iTerm MCP Systematic Validation

## Mission
Systematically validate, test, and fix the Enhanced iTerm MCP at `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/` to ensure all 35+ advanced automation tools are operational and the critical AppleScript variable naming fixes work correctly.

## Current Status
- ✅ AppleScript variable naming fixes applied to source code (user.* prefixes)
- ✅ Code rebuilt with `npm run build` 
- ✅ Enhanced iTerm MCP server started manually
- ❌ `create_session` command still timing out (likely server connection issue)
- ❌ Need comprehensive validation of all functionality

## Key Issues to Investigate & Fix
1. **Server Connection**: Enhanced iTerm MCP server is running but CDT may not be connecting properly
2. **AppleScript Variables**: Verify the user.* prefix fixes are working in practice
3. **Session Management**: Core session creation, enumeration, communication functions
4. **Advanced Features**: 35+ enhanced tools need systematic testing

## Your Tasks

### Phase 1: Environment Diagnosis & Core Fixes
```bash
# 1. Check server processes and connections
ps aux | grep -E "(enhanced-iterm|mcp)" | grep -v grep

# 2. Verify Claude Desktop config includes enhanced-iterm-mcp
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | grep -A5 enhanced-iterm

# 3. Test if server is responsive
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp 2>/dev/null || echo "Server not responding on standard port"

# 4. Check for any server startup errors
cd ~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp && node dist/index.js --test 2>&1 | head -20
```

### Phase 2: Systematic Testing Protocol
Execute this testing sequence and document results:

```bash
# Test 1: Basic session creation (the critical fix)
# This should work without "user variable" AppleScript errors
echo "Testing session creation..."

# Test 2: Session enumeration
echo "Testing session enumeration..."

# Test 3: Multi-session management
echo "Testing multi-session capabilities..."

# Test 4: Advanced features sampling
echo "Testing enhanced automation tools..."
```

### Phase 3: Fix Any Issues Found
- If AppleScript variable errors persist, check if server is using old compiled version
- If server connection fails, investigate MCP protocol implementation
- If specific tools fail, debug individual tool implementations
- Document all fixes applied

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Diagnosis Report**: Current state, issues found, root causes identified
2. **Fix Implementation**: All critical issues resolved with working session management
3. **Validation Results**: Comprehensive test results proving functionality works
4. **Documentation Update**: Updated session learnings and known working patterns

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Session creation works without AppleScript errors
- ✅ Multi-session management operational
- ✅ Enhanced automation tools functional
- ✅ Real-world development workflow ready

## Key Files & Context
- **Main Project**: `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/`
- **Memory Bank**: `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/memory-bank/`
- **Session Learnings**: `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/memory-bank/session-learnings-2025-05-27.md`
- **Source Code**: `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/src/`
- **Compiled Code**: `~/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/dist/`

## Claude Desktop MCP Config Context
The Enhanced iTerm MCP should be configured in Claude Desktop as:
```json
"enhanced-iterm-mcp": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/tools/mcp/enhanced-iterm-mcp/dist/index.js"]
}
```

## Previous Investigation Summary
We discovered that:
1. Source code has correct `user.` prefixes for AppleScript variables
2. After rebuild, compiled code also has correct prefixes
3. Server was restarted but CDT connection may be stale
4. Both standard `iterm-mcp` and `enhanced-iterm-mcp` are configured

## Testing Philosophy
- **Systematic**: Test each component methodically
- **Fix-Forward**: Fix issues as you find them
- **Document**: Record all findings for future reference
- **Practical**: Focus on business-critical functionality first

Begin with Phase 1 diagnosis and proceed systematically. This is a high-priority validation that will unlock significant AI automation capabilities for professional services.
